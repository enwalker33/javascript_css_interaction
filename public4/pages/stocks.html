  <h5>Invest</h5>
  <p>The difference between stocks and bonds is that
   stocks are shares
   in the ownership of a business, while bonds are a
   form of debt that
   the issuing entity promises to repay at some point
   in the future.
   This means that stocks are a riskier investment
   than bonds.</p>
